## Introduction

Lung cancer is one of the leading causes of cancer-related deaths worldwide. Early detection can significantly improve the survival rates. This project leverages deep learning and the ResNet50 architecture to develop a model that can assist in the detection of lung cancer from medical images.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of labeled medical images of lung tissue. Ensure you have the appropriate permissions and ethical considerations in place for using any medical data.

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required dependencies:
